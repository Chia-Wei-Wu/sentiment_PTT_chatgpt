## Motivation
* “ChatGPT” is a large-scale language model based on the GPT-3.5 architecture with potential for a wide range of applications, especially in social media.
* “PTT” attracts many users with its free and open discussion environment and diverse topics. It is a platform for people to exchange opinions, share knowledge and build communities.
* “FB” is also the top choice that tech people often discuss new trends on not only groups but fan pages, even on their personal profile.
* Hence, we analyze the direction of ChatGPT's public opinion on PTT to understand the usage of ChatGPT on social media.
